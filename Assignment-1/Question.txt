Consider the SAT on PTA that you attempted. 

If your roll number ends in an even number use Delta T_min =9 C, 

If your roll number ends in an odd number use Delta T_min =11 C, 
For this, determine 
 1. pinch point, min cooling and heating.  Sketch the hot and cold  composite curves. You may use your favourite plotting/graphing software. 

2. Minimum area required (area target)

3. Minimum number of units (using pinch rules)

4. Total cost target

 

You may use the following information

U=0.001 MW/m^2 C

Heating is available at 300  C (Steam)

cooling is provided by cooling water at 15 C with a maximum return temperature of 30 C

Cost of heat exchanger 40000 + 500 A, where A is area in sq m

Cost of steam =1,20,000 (/MW/y)

Cost of cooling water= 10,000 (/MW/y)

Use annualization factor =0.25
